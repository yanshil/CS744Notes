## Graph Process

* Problem setup and constraints
* Graph - specific
	* Pregel, Graphlab
* Programming model, storage, executer

### Input:

Large graph (directed)

v -> property / value (rank)

e -> property (weight)


### Graph algorithm

* page rank
	* Iterative: some amount of work state updated
* s-t shortest paths
* matching
* connected components
* cuts
* coloring
	
### Vertex-centric computation

* computation in a given vertex

1. f(current state/value of vertex), updates vertex and edge values; update from other iters.
2. Made visible to other vertices


Pregel

* Message passing: pregel ---> B.S.P.: synchronous
* Distributed Share Memory (D.S.M.): Graphlab  ---> Asynchronous

Ex. Greedy graph coloring 

* synchronous ---> cannot converge

#### Gather
* commutative
* associative
* funciton on messages

#### Apply
* output of gather,
* current value of vertex -> update calues of vertex of incident edge

Scatter: vertex or edge values to other vertices 
* GAS model (vertex centric computation)

#### Hash (vertex IDs)

Edge-cut partition

1. communication asynm
2. computation asynm
3. parellize a high-degree vertex's work

balanced vertex-cuts

Each vertex:
* incoming messages
* apply -> update
* generate outgoing messages
	* queued @ input
	* queued of message targets
	
#### F.T.

failure -> lost ith iterations vertex/edge values

* every nth iteration -> checkpoint (values of vertices /edges, incoming message)
	waste of work on non-faile partition(if only one partition failed we have to recompute on all)
* confined recovery: logs outgoing messages
